# Project Name: Limited Edition Social Media Platform

![Team Photo](https://i.imgur.com/bTG56lp.jpg)

Introducing the next best social media! We're a platform that aims to maximize engagement while minimizing social clout. Gone are the like counters, the emphasis on who's following who and how high your follower count is. Instead, we restrict the number of unique views per post. Once a post's views are gone... *poof* the post also disappears. Welcome to a social media platform that breaks all the rules.
