## Our Story

Introducing the next best social media! We're a platform that aims to **maximize engagement** while **minimizing social clout**. Gone are the like counters, the emphasis on who's following who and how high your follower count is. Instead, we restrict the number of unique views per post and give you the option to hide your follower/following count. Once a post's views are gone... *poof* the post also disappears. 

Our platform attempts to innovate on the existing social media landscape by giving users a bit more control over how their content is curated. We seek to improve transparency and enhance engagement.

Welcome to a social media platform that breaks all the rules.
