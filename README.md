# Project Name: Limited Edition Social Media Platform

![Team Photo](https://i.imgur.com/bTG56lp.jpg)

A social media platform that restricts the number of unique viewers per post. Once a post's views are gone it disappears.

This platform attempts to innovate the existing social media landscape by also giving users a bit more control over how their content is curated. We seek to improve transparency and enhance engagement.
